        <H3>Introduction:</H3>
        <p>This story unfolds in the Clover Kingdom, a realm where magic reigns supreme. Here, the kingdom's protection lies in the hands of magic knights who serve alongside the powerful wizard king.
            Within the common realm of this kingdom lies a village called Hage. It is in this humble village that two orphans, Asta and Yuno, find themselves. Abandoned and left in the care of a church in Hage, their fates take contrasting turns.
            Yuno, a striking and charismatic young boy, possesses an abundance of mana and wields formidable magical abilities. 
            <Br />In contrast, Asta is quite the opposite. He is a short and unremarkable boy who lacks any trace of mana, rendering him unable to perform magic. Despite this seemingly insurmountable obstacle, Asta harbors an unwavering determination to one day become the wizard king.
            Every day, Asta tirelessly works towards his dream. He ventures into the woods to train his physical strength, all while being just fourteen years old and unable to harness any magical powers.

        <H3>Asta gets a Grimoire</H3>
        <p>Once a year, in the Clover Kingdom, a significant event unfolds where all the fifteen-year-olds are gathered for an awarding ceremony. This ceremony grants them their own grimoires, which have the remarkable ability to enhance their magical powers. Asta eagerly anticipated this day,
             believing that receiving a grimoire would miraculously grant him magical abilities. The time for the grimoire awarding had arrived, but to his dismay, everyone except Asta was bestowed with one. In a stunning turn of events, Yuno received a four-leaf clover grimoire, an exceedingly rare and legendary tome reserved for exceptional mages.

            <Br />Despite the disappointment of not receiving a grimoire, Asta remained resolute in his pursuit of becoming the wizard king. He continued his rigorous training, venturing into the wilderness each day to build his physical strength, despite being only fourteen years old and unable to wield magic.
            
            On the night of the grimoire awarding ceremony, as Yuno was making his way home, he was accosted by a bandit seeking to steal his coveted four-leaf clover grimoire and profit from its sale. Yuno found himself trapped, unable to act, as the bandit used chain magic to immobilize him. Just as the bandit was about to make off with Yuno's grimoire,
             Asta swooped in and demanded its return. The bandit, amused by the sight of a seemingly powerless boy challenging him, burst into laughter and easily subdued Asta. He taunted Asta, belittling his ambitions of becoming the wizard king, citing his lack of magical ability and absence of a grimoire, pushing Asta to the brink of giving up.
            
            <Br />However, Yuno intervened, declaring Asta as his rival and urging the bandit not to underestimate him. These words rekindled Asta's determination, filling him with courage. At that crucial moment, a tattered grimoire adorned with a five-leaf clover materialized before Asta, and a large sword emerged from it. 
            This sword possessed the remarkable ability to nullify all magic in the vicinity, leaving the chain-wielding bandit defenseless. Asta seized the sword, defeated the bandit, and saved Yuno. Together, they returned home, their spirits uplifted and their bond as rivals strengthened.

        <H3>Asta and Yuno take the magic knights exam</H3>
           <p>
            Asta and Yuno made a resolute decision to represent Hage Village in the Magic Knights entrance exams, a pivotal step toward their shared dream of becoming the Wizard King. After a month of dedicated training, they embarked on their journey to the royal capital, the site of the exams. Before leaving, they bid farewell to the church and the orphanage members,
             who held doubts about Asta's chances of success and advised him to return home after his expected failure.

Their journey to the royal capital took just a few days, and without delay, they headed to the examination venue. There, they encountered numerous candidates from various cities and backgrounds, all aspiring to join the prestigious Magic Knights. The exams began promptly, with the nine Magic Knights captains in attendance, eager to identify promising talents for their squads.

Yuno quickly became the center of attention due to his possession of a four-leaf clover grimoire, a rare and powerful symbol. In contrast, Asta stood out primarily due to his lack of mana and his vocal proclamation of his ambition to become the next Wizard King. Despite his inability to use magic effectively, Asta persevered through most of the exams.

The final and decisive exam focused on testing the candidates' combat abilities. Asta struck up a friendship with another candidate named Sekke, who appeared friendly but had ulterior motives. Sekke believed that defeating Asta would impress the captains and secure his own place in the Magic Knights.
<Br />He challenged Asta to a match, and although Asta humbly accepted, Sekke's derogatory remarks angered him. When the match began, Asta swiftly defeated Sekke with a single strike of his sword, stunning everyone, including the captains. The only one unsurprised by this outcome was Yuno.

As the exams concluded, it was time for the captains to select candidates for their squads. Each candidate stepped forward, hoping to garner the captains' favor. However, when Asta's turn came, none of the captains raised their hands in interest. Undeterred, Asta continued to express his determination, declaring that he wasn't finished. It was then that the captain of the Black Bulls,
 Yami Sukehiro, unleashed a powerful aura that shook the ground and struck fear into all the candidates. Yami approached Asta and questioned whether he still had the nerve to claim he would become the Wizard King now that he stood before him. Despite his fear, 
Asta summoned the courage to reply that while he might not be joining the Magic Knights at that moment, he would never give up on his dream of becoming the Wizard King.Yami, taken aback by Asta's unwavering determination and spirit, burst into laughter. He extended an invitation to Asta, welcoming him to join his squad, the Black Bulls. Asta, overwhelmed with surprise and joy, gladly accepted the offer.

Asta then accompanied Yami to the Black Bulls' hideout, where he had the opportunity to meet the rest of the squad members. This marked the beginning of Asta's journey as a member of the Black Bulls, bringing him one step closer to his dream of becoming the Wizard King.
